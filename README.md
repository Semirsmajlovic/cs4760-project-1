Project #1

Repo: https://github.com/Semirsmajlovic/cs4760-project-1

Description:
- This program has one simple task with various different commands, so there are numerous callbacks that can be called using -h, -p, -c, -s, -i. Each of these variables have a proper defition which will be explained below:

- -h (This is used to show tbe help options).
- -p (This is to show how many processes we would like to run).
- -c (Thiss is the number of characters that we want to include).
- -s (This indicated how long processes should sleep).
- -i (Last, but not least, the number of iterations we would like to run through).

How to successfully run the program:
- make chain
- ./chain (-h) -p 10 -c 3 -s 10 -i 4
- make clean (To delete the file).

Difficulties:
- I felt that the project itself was very descriptive and that all of the needed information was described, but being novice in C and not using it for about 3 years, I had to rethink and relearn a lot of things. One of the hardest parts was step 8, where I need to input a file and make it work with a specific file, which I was not able to do successfully.
